    <h2>Introduction To Growth Investing</h2>
    <p>People have many different styles and tastes when it comes to money, but making your money grow is typically considered the most fundamental investment objective. The best way to accomplish this goal will vary according to factors such as the investor's risk tolerance and time horizon. But there are some principles and techniques that are applicable for many different types of investors and growth strategies. </p>

    <h3>Types of Growth Investments</h3>
    <p><em><strong>Small-Cap Stocks</strong></em><br />
      The size of a company is based on its market capitalization, or net worth. There is no exact, universal definition of what is considered to be "small cap" compared to micro, mid or large cap, but most analysts classify any company with a capitalization of between $300 million and $2 billion as a small-cap firm. Companies in this category are often still in their initial phase of growth and their stocks have the potential for substantial appreciation in price. Small-cap stocks have historically posted higher returns than their blue-chip cousins, but they are also considerably more volatile and carry a higher degree of risk. Small-cap stocks have also often outperformed large-cap stocks during periods of recovery from recessions.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Technology and Healthcare Stocks</strong></em><br />
      Companies that develop new technologies or offer innovations in healthcare can be excellent choices for investors who are looking for a home-run play in their portfolios. The stocks of companies that develop popular or revolutionary products can rise exponentially in price in a relatively short period of time. For example, the price of Pfizer was just under $5 a share in 1994 before Viagra was released. This blockbuster drug took the company's stock price to above $30 a share over the next five years, thanks to FDA approval of the drug in 1998.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Speculative Investments</strong></em><br />
      Thrill seekers and speculators look to high-risk growth instruments such as penny stocks, futures and options contracts, foreign currency and speculative real estate such as undeveloped land. There are also oil and gas drilling partnerships and private equity for aggressive investors in high income brackets. Those who pick the right choices in this arena can see a return on capital of many times their initial investment, but they can also often lose every cent of their principal.</p>
    <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
    <p>Growth investing is a complex subject that is often closely coupled with other subjects such as fundamental analysis, technical analysis and market research. There are many more growth strategies used by individual and institutional investors, and a complete listing of them is far beyond the scope of this article. For more information on growth strategies for your investments, consult your broker or financial advisor. </p>
